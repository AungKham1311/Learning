    <span class="lycp12">great big bang and dinosaurs        
    Fiery raining meteors       
    It all ends unfortunately           
    But you're gonna live forever in me     
    I guarantee, just wait and see      

    Parts of me were made by you        
    And planets keep their distance too     
    The moon's got a grip on the sea        
    And you're gonna live forever in me     
    I guarantee, it's your destiny    </span>  

    <span class="lycp34">Life is full of sweet mistakes      
    And love's an honest one to make     
    Time leaves no fruit on the tree     
    But you're gonna live forever in me     
    I guarantee, it's just meant to be      

    And when the pastor asks the pews    
    For reasons he can't marry you      
    I'll keep my word and my seat       
    But you're gonna live forever in me     
    I guarantee, just wait and see      </span>
