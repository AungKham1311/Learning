    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <pre>        A great big bang and dinosaurs
        Fiery raining meteors
        It all ends unfortunately
        But you're gonna live forever in me
        I guarantee, just wait and see

        Parts of me were made by you
        And planets keep their distance too
        The moon's got a grip on the sea
        And you're gonna live forever in me
        I guarantee, it's your destiny

        Life is full of sweet mistakes
        And love's an honest one to make
        Time leaves no fruit on the tree
        But you're gonna live forever in me
        I guarantee, it's just meant to be

        And when the pastor asks the pews
        For reasons he can't marry you
        I'll keep my word and my seat
        But you're gonna live forever in me
        I guarantee, just wait and see</pre>
